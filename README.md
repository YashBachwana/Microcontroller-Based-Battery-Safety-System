# 🔋 Microcontroller Based Battery Safety Monitoring System

An embedded systems project aimed at developing a real-time safety monitoring system for batteries. The system uses a multimodal sensor setup to detect early signs of battery failure and categorizes operational states into *Safe*, *Cooldown*, and *Evacuation* based on sensor data.

## 📋 Overview

This project utilizes the **STM32 Nucleo-L439ZI** boards to build a dual-board communication and monitoring system. It continuously monitors the following parameters:

- **Temperature**
- **Pressure**
- **Voltage**
- **Smoke levels**

The raw sensor data is collected, mapped to realistic values, and processed to determine the battery's safety state.

## ⚙️ System Architecture

- **Board 1**: Reads raw ADC values from the sensors and displays them on a local LCD.
- **Board 2**: Receives sensor data via UART, processes it, and shows processed states on a mounted LCD.
